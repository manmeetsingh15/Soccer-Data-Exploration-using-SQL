# Soccer-Data-Exploration-using-SQL
SQL-based analysis of the European Soccer Database, exploring matches, players, leagues, and key insights
Purpose

This project was undertaken to strengthen my expertise in SQL and to demonstrate how complex datasets can be explored to uncover meaningful insights. The European Soccer Database, with its breadth of information on players, teams, and matches, served as an excellent platform for practicing data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis.

Key SQL Concepts

To better understand the work done in this project, here are some fundamental SQL concepts that were applied:

Database Connectivity: Setting up and navigating through the database.

Countries Overview: Extracting the list of countries included in the dataset.

Leagues and Nations: Linking leagues to their respective countries.

Teams Data: Investigating the participating teams.

Match Records: Gathering insights from match-related data.

Introductory Analytics: Running basic analytical queries to generate initial findings.

Dataset Overview

The European Soccer Database is a large-scale dataset created for analysts, data scientists, and soccer enthusiasts. It contains more than 25,000 match records, over 10,000 player details, and various features sourced from the FIFA video game series. This makes it highly suitable for SQL-based exploration and predictive modeling.

Dataset Components

Matches: 25,000+ games played between 2008â€“2016 across 11 European nations.

Players: Profiles of 10,000+ players, including FIFA attributes.

Leagues: Championship details across 11 countries.

Lineups: Squad formations with player coordinates.

Betting Odds: Data from up to 10 betting providers.

Events: Rich details on goals, possession, fouls, corners, and more.

Workflow

Setup & Exploration: Establish database connection and review tables.

Countries & Leagues: Query for country data and league distribution.

Teams & Matches: Retrieve team information and analyze match records.

Analytics: Perform exploratory and foundational SQL analysis.

Execution Flow: Understand query execution order in SQL.

Advanced Queries: Implement subqueries and SQL functions for deeper insights.

How to Get Started

Dataset: Download and set up the European Soccer Database locally.

Clone Repository: git clone https://github.com/Gokul-Raja84/Data-Analysis-using-SQL

Run Queries: Execute the provided SQL scripts using Jupyter Notebook or any SQL environment.
